/*
Basic Euclidean Algorithm for GCD: 
The algorithm is based on the below facts. 
=>  If we subtract a smaller number from a larger one (we reduce a larger number), 
    GCD doesnâ€™t change. So if we keep subtracting repeatedly the larger of two, we end up with GCD.
=>  Now instead of subtraction, if we divide the smaller number, 
    the algorithm stops when we find the remainder 0.
