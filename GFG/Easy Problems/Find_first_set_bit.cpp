/*
Find first set bit
Given an integer N. The task is to return the position of first set bit found from the right side in the binary representation of the number.
Note: If there is no set bit in the integer N, then return 0 from the function.  

Example 1:

Input: 
N = 18
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
Binary representation of 18 is 010010,the first set bit from the right side is at position 2.
Example 2:

Input: 
N = 12 
Output: 
3 
Explanation: 
Binary representation of  12 is 1100, the first set bit from the right side is at position 3.
Your Task:
The task is to complete the function getFirstSetBit() that takes an integer n as a parameter and returns the position of first set bit.

Expected Time Complexity: O(log N).
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1).

Constraints:
0 <= N <= 108
