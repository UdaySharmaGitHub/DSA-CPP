/*
Given an expression string x. Examine whether the pairs and the orders of {,},(,),[,] are correct in exp.
For example, the function should return 'true' for exp = [()]{}{[()()]()} and 'false' for exp = [(]).

Note: The drive code prints "balanced" if function return true, otherwise it prints "not balanced".

Example 1:

Input:
{([])}
Output: 
true
Explanation: 
{ ( [ ] ) }. Same colored brackets can form 
balanced pairs, with 0 number of 
unbalanced bracket.
Example 2:

Input: 
()
Output: 
true
Explanation: 
(). Same bracket can form balanced pairs, 
and here only 1 type of bracket is 
present and in balanced way.
Example 3:

Input: 
([]
Output: 
false
Explanation: 
([]. Here square bracket is balanced but 
the small bracket is not balanced and 
Hence , the output will be unbalanced.
Your Task:
This is a function problem. You only need to complete the function ispar() that takes a string as a parameter and returns a boolean value true if brackets are balanced else returns false. The printing is done automatically by the driver code.

Expected Time Complexity: O(|x|)
Expected Auixilliary Space: O(|x|)

Constraints:
1 ≤ |x| ≤ 32000

Approach:-
Intuition
The problem requires us to determine if the given string of brackets is valid or not. We can use a stack data structure to keep track of opening brackets encountered and check if they match with the corresponding closing brackets.

Approach
Here is the step-by-step approach of the algorithm:

Initialize an empty stack.

Traverse the input string character by character.

If the current character is an opening bracket (i.e., '(', '{', '['), push it onto the stack.

If the current character is a closing bracket (i.e., ')', '}', ']'), check if the stack is empty. If it is empty, return false, because the closing bracket does not have a corresponding opening bracket. Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the current closing bracket. If it does not match, return false, because the brackets are not valid.

After traversing the entire input string, if the stack is empty, return true, because all opening brackets have been matched with their corresponding closing brackets. Otherwise, return false, because some opening brackets have not been matched with their corresponding closing brackets.

Complexity
Time complexity:
The time complexity of the solution is O(n)O(n)O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we traverse the string once and perform constant time operations for each character.

Space complexity:
The space complexity of the solution is O(n)O(n)O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because the worst-case scenario is when all opening brackets are present in the string and the stack will have to store them all.
